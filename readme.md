# Maybe Sharp
Rust-style implementation of the "Maybe" monad (In Rust, this monad is called Option) into C#

## Usage (C#)
1. Copy maybe.cs file into your project
2. Put this at the top of your code
```cs
using MaybeSharp;
```
3. Start using MaybeSharp in your code! (if you don't know how, the test.cs file shows example usages)

## Usage (C# + .NET)
1. Copy maybe.cs and maybe-dotnet.cs file into your project
2. Put this at the top of your code
```cs
using MaybeSharp;
using MaybeDotnet;
```
3. Start using MaybeSharp + MaybeDotnet in your code!
