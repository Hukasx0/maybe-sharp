# Maybe Sharp
Rust-style implementation of the "Maybe" monad (In Rust, this monad is called Option) into C#

## Usage
1. Copy maybe.cs file into your project
2. Put this at the top of your code
```cs
using MaybeSharp;
```
3. Start using MaybeSharp in your code! (if you don't know how, the test.cs file shows example usages)
